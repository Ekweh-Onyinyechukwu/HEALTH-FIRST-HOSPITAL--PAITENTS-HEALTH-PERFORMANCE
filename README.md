## SUMMARIZED KEY METRICS:
- Glucose level by patient’s gender
- Smoking rate of patient’s by gender
- Cholesterol level by patient’s gender
- Level of dys .bp by patient’s gender
- Sys. Bp grading of patient by gender
- Level of alcohol of patient by gender
- Level of physical activites of patient by gender
- Level of cardiovascular risk factor of patient by gender
- Average weights counts of patient’s by gender

  ## KEY INSIGHTS:
- The male gender smoking rate is 8%, compared to the female gender that is 1%
- Count of glucose level of the female is 55%, compared to the malegender that is 30%
- Count of cholesterol level of the female gender is 48%, compared to the male gender is 27%
- Level of alcoholism of the male is 31%, compared the female is 63%
- Count of level of physical activities of the female is 52%,compared male is 28%  and much more

## FINDINGS:
- With this analysis it shows the female gender suffers more high cholesterol level than the male gender and high cardiovascular risk factor which may be as a result of high systolic and dystolic Blood pressure, high alcohol intake, and high glucose level (of which this should be looked into)
- I also discovered the female gender are more active in physical activities than the male gender, thereby keeping them in normal weight than the male gender
- The male gender also suffer high weight counts than the female gender which could be as a result of smoking.
